Analyzing Amazon reviews with PySpark

## Overview
In this project data was analyzed from the Amazon Vine program to see if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from the Vine members. The Amazon Vine program is a service that lets manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies will pay a fee to amazon and provide products to vine members, who then are required to leave a review. The dataset I used was for **Musical Instruments**. Google Colab and PySpark were used to perform the ETL process.<br>
